* TODO:
- support MPI-2 collectives
- support MPI-2 Features (MPI_IN_PLACE)
- support MPI-2 Requests (really? -> I don't think so - Generalized
  Requests *SUCK*:)
- BUG: if we issue on one node MPI_Igather and on another node
  MPI_Ibcast, the packets will match illegally becase the tag assignment
  is not aware of the collective type!

* Missing for MPI-1:
- add user defined operations (coll9, coll10, coll11, longuser)
-- how do we ensure that we do not collide with Intrinsic Operations if
   we issue NBC_Ops???
-- we cannot issue NBC_Ops ... we need to issue MPI_Ops :-(. 
-- hmm, we could simply wrap it and save the user defined op in a
   list (hash) and search this every time we get called 
   --> cool idea, let's do that ...
